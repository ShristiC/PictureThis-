#PictureThis!

A mobile app developed in correspondence with Texas Convergent for Spring 2020 as part of a community culture project. Developed in a team of 5 people. 

PictureThis is a cross-platform app that lets users to explore local, authentic places in a cheaper and more genuine way. Through a google maps API, pins, and crowd-sourced based information users can see the "hottest" points of attraction near them and go on to further explore it.

## App Details:
FrontEnd - The UI was developed through React Native
There is a stack implementation of the Google Maps API, Camera API, and the functionality to place pins on desired locations.
BackEnd - We use a MongoDB server to query the geographical information retrieved from posts made on the app, and accordingly place a pin on that location and get more information regarding it.
